This version of WRFv3.7.1 contains an implementation of Hugh Morrison's two-moment microphysics
scheme with predicted cloud droplet number concentration.

This implementation was ported from a WRVv3.1 implementation made by Amy Solomon (NOAA).

This code is currently coupled to the YSU boundary layer scheme and the Goddard SW radiation scheme.
The Goddard radiation scheme takes cloud and ice effective radii from the microphysics.

The Morrison predicted CDNC scheme can be used by setting mp_physics = 101 in the namelist.input

Please see the microphysics scheme in phys/module_mp_graupel.F for details of the 
microphysics scheme and contact details for Hugh Morrison.
