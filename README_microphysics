This version of WRFv3.7.1 contains an implementation of Hugh Morrison's two-moment microphysics
scheme with predicted cloud droplet number concentration.

This implementation was ported from a WRVv3.1 implementation made by Amy Solomon (NOAA).

This code is currently coupled to the YSU boundary layer scheme (bl_pbl_physics option 1 in the &physics
namelist) and the Goddard SW radiation scheme (ra_sw_physics option 2 in the &physics
namelist). The Goddard radiation scheme takes cloud and ice effective radii from the microphysics.

The Morrison predicted CDNC scheme can be used by setting mp_physics = 101 in the namelist.input

To run in idealised mode (with no PBL scheme), make sure to set ISUB = 1 in the 
microphysics scheme phys/module_mp_graupel.F, and clean and recompile.

Please see the microphysics scheme in phys/module_mp_graupel.F for details of the 
microphysics scheme and contact details for Hugh Morrison.
